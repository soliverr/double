## General Considerations

This document outlines the core ideas treated as shared rules and community-endorsed concepts for the Double project.

If you do not agree with the ideas and concepts below, you have two options:

1. Do not participate in the Double project and try to implement your ideas as a separate project.
2. Present your ideas as described in section [#ideas] and, together with other contributors, help the project evolve by merging individual knowledge and concepts into the Double knowledge tree.

## Grand Idea

The central paradigm of the project is to create a personal digital twin of one’s knowledge, skills, and capabilities for interacting with the digital world and computing ecosystems.

A personal digital twin is initially a bundle of skills for interacting with information systems in the broadest sense—interactions through computing devices (computers, smartphones, gadgets) and interactions directed at you from the digital world.

The digital twin is created as your personal copy of skills and should continually evolve and improve.

By choice and consent of project participants, local personal digital twins can be merged to create a shared, universal agent validated by all Double contributors, aggregating the best personal skills from participants.

The universal Double agent can act as a mentor for the local digital twins of new participants or users of the Double project.

This establishes the project’s foundational principle:

 **Build an open system for accumulating and exchanging knowledge among all Double project participants.**
 
*The accumulated knowledge and skills may be **open**, available to any participant or external user, or **restricted**, available individually or via paid subscription.*

## Goals


Goals relevant to all participants are located in [[goals]].

To clarify and plan tasks for achieving goals, the [[goals]] directory contains subdirectories for goals and subgoals with files listing the tasks to solve.

Use [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) for complex goals described with multiple words.

## Participants

Each participant creates a personal file in [[people]]. This file serves as the participant’s unique identifier and is referenced in metadata for other project resources. Content must comply with generally accepted moral standards and the law.

## Ideas

Individual ideas live in [[ideas]], where each participant creates their own subdirectory.

The hierarchy and content of personal idea directories should be structured uniformly to simplify merging individual knowledge into group-wide knowledge.

## Skills

Shared skills are stored in [[skills]].

Each skill gets its own directory. Use widely recognized English words for skill names. Use [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) for multiword skills.

## History

Important historical milestones of the project are captured in participants’ individual knowledge.

Below are the key milestones in the project’s evolution.
